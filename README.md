# teal-type-checker.nvim

This is a very temporary solution for LSP-like features until the Teal language server is actually written.

Right now it just puts some virtual text next to syntax and type errors, has no integration with `tlconfig.lua` so using it with modules is a bad time. This won't be implemented as that is a feature for the lsp.
